# Echo Field

An experimental social space where thoughts echo endlessly through nested conversations. Built with React and TypeScript.

## 🌀 About

Echo Field is an art project exploring the concept of infinite conversation nesting. Each comment can spawn its own thread of responses, creating a fractal-like structure of human interaction.

Key features:
- Infinitely nestable comments
- Dark/light theme switching
- Minimalist interface
- Real-time updates
- Thread collapsing

## 🚀 Getting Started

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your system.

```sh
# Clone the repository
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>

# Navigate to project directory
cd digital-canvas

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- React + TypeScript
- Vite
- shadcn/ui components
- Tailwind CSS
- Supabase (for data persistence)

## 💭 Philosophy

Echo Field explores how conversations branch and evolve in digital spaces. Like echoes in a canyon, each comment has the potential to spawn infinite reflections, creating emergent patterns of dialogue.

The project intentionally strips away traditional social media elements like usernames, likes, counts of comments and timestamps, focusing purely on the content and its position in the conversation tree.
