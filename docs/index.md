# Echo Field

An experimental social space where thoughts echo endlessly through nested conversations. Built with React and TypeScript.

The project intentionally strips away traditional social media elements like usernames, likes, counts of comments and timestamps, focusing purely on the content and its position in the conversation tree.

## 🌀 About

Echo Field is an art project exploring the concept of infinite conversation nesting. Each comment can spawn its own thread of responses, creating a fractal-like structure of human interaction.

## 💭 Philosophy

Echo Field explores how conversations branch and evolve in digital spaces. Like echoes in a canyon, each comment has the potential to spawn infinite reflections, creating emergent patterns of dialogue.

Key features:
- Infinitely nestable comments
- Visualize the nest
- Dark/light theme switching
- Minimalist interface
- Thread collapsing
