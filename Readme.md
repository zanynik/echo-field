# Echo Field
An experimental art project built on [Nostr](https://nostr.com/).

## 🌀 Concept

Echo Field is an art project designed to create the world's largest **infinite human chain of comments**.

It visualizes conversations as they branch and evolve in digital spaces. Like echoes in a canyon, each comment has the potential to spawn infinite reflections, creating emergent fractal patterns of human interaction.

## 💭 Philosophy

There are long threaded chains of comments on social networks like Reddit and Facebook, but they are all limited. They live on private servers, controlled by single entities. A moderator can delete a thread, a company can shut down a server, or an algorithm can hide your voice.

**Echo Field is different.**

It is built on the **Nostr** open protocol.
- **Unstoppable**: The data lives on thousands of independent relays. No single person or company controls it.
- **Permanent**: Once signed with your key, your voice cannot be deleted or censored by a central authority.
- **Infinite**: The protocol supports infinite nesting and extension.

This project is a visualization of that power. We are building a permanent, unbreakable chain of human thought.

## 🚀 Participating

1. **Login**: Use a Nostr extension (like Alby) or your private key (`nsec`).
2. **Post**: Add your thought to the chain.
3. **Explore**: Traverse the infinite nest of echoes.
